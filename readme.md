Broodwar Lib
============

Broodwar lib was a hack to be injected into a running process of Broodwar. This hack had several features to be used while in a game. The most notable exploit here was one that could be used to drop another player from a game by making their own client desync them from the global game state, thus dropping them. This was written back in 2004.
